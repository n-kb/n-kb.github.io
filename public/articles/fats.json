All of these commodities were crushed and refined into one final product: fat.\n\nFat had been scarce in Europe for most people, most of the time. Starting in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, it became more and more abundant. It was needed for lamps and lubricating machinery but, as mineral oils became widely available, the use of vegetable fats became more concentrated in soap-making and, what interests me here, food.<sup><a name='note_2' id='#note_2' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_2'>2</a></sup>\n\nAlone among the major foodstuffs, fats were largely imported. Animal fats were often imported from the R\u00edo de la Plata and from the United States, and vegetable fats were almost exclusively imported from colonial situations<sup><a name='note_3' id='#note_3' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_3'>3</a></sup>.\n\n<iframe title=\"Fat difference\" aria-label=\"Stacked Bars\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-Parr7\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Parr7/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"477\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\n</script>\n\nThe abundance of fats in Europe led to dramatic changes. Production and sales of soap skyrocketed. On the food front, it allowed for a massive expansion of deep-frying, which is probably linked with the growing popularity of French fries, Frikadelle or fish-and-chips<sup><a name='note_4' id='#note_4' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_4'>4</a></sup>. It also boosted the ice cream industry, which was one of the main buyers of coconut oil in the 1920s<sup><a name='note_5' id='#note_5' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_5'>5</a></sup>.\n\nI discovered the link between the colonial context in which these vegetable fats were produced and the foodstuffs made from these oils eaten in Europe while writing _Voracism: Three centuries of white supremacy in food_ (published in 2021). I found it so fascinating that I decided to research it in details for a doctoral thesis, which professor G\u00fcnther Hirschfelder of Regensburg University very kindly accepted to supervise.\n\nI will spend part of the upcoming years looking at the cultural history of colonial vegetable fats in France and Germany between 1871 (when margarine \u2013 a key innovation that lets industrialists merge different fats together \u2013 was first produced and Germany unified) until 1933 (when the German government led by the Nazis monopolized the edible fats business). I plan to organize my research along three axes.\n\n### A cultural interpretation of volumes and prices\n\nThe theory of demand and supply has some limitations, and I explored how cultural traits \u2013 rather than market forces \u2013 could become the main drivers of prices in my upcoming book _Full-time imposture_ (to be published 2022).\n\nWhen it comes to fats, marginalist economics are of little use. This theory, which became hegemonic in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, requires products to have intrinsic qualities. But fats do not. Contemporaries agreed on one thing: it was close to impossible to notice if one was buying butter or margarine.<sup><a name='note_6' id='#note_6' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_6'>6</a></sup> In other words, the prices of different fats was determined by cultural factors rather than \"the market\".\n\nHeeding the calls of several food or cultural historians,<sup><a name='note_7' id='#note_7' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_7'>7</a></sup> I will study prices as cultural artefacts. In particular, information about the evolution of the price of vegetable fats relative to butter will yield insights on the acceptance of these exotic produce by merchants and by the population. Another avenue of research will be the abundant literature on fraud, which implicitely reveals the commercial hierarchy of fats (those at the top are often falsified, those at the bottom are never imitated).\n\n### An examination of advertising strategies\n\nManufacturers of produce made from colonial vegetable fats (chiefly margarine, coconut butter and oil) attempted to influence the perceptions of these fats. A common slogan throughout the period is that a margarine \"is worth butter\" \u2013 its longevity itself a testament to its impotence.\n\nMore precisely, I will focus on the representations of colonial subjects in advertising for colonial vegetable fats. Manufacturers, which often sold and marketed soap alongside margarine and oil, were at the forefront of innovation in advertising. Lever Brothers, for instance, spent more than 10% of sales on advertising in the first decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><a name='note_8' id='#note_8' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_8'>8</a></sup> Palmin, taking a hint from Liebig, printed million of chromolithographic cards between 1903 and 1914<sup><a name='note_9' id='#note_9' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_9'>9</a></sup>. Rama pioneered free brand magazine for children with _Der kleine Coco_ (1909-1915). Often, this advertising used colonial themes.\n\nThis advertisement for V\u00e9g\u00e9taline (a brand of Rocca, Tassy & de Roux of Marseilles), for instance, uses age-old tropes of racial distinction. The small, Black child is made to enhance the whiteness and the position of the chef. It is likely that the artist, Eug\u00e8ne Og\u00e9, was aware of the long tradition of representing Black servants in front of their mistress<sup><a name='note_10' id='#note_10' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_10'>10</a></sup>.\n\n<div class=\"columns\">\n\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t![Advertisement for V\u00e9g\u00e9taline, 1910](https://blog.nkb.fr/public/images/1910-V\u00e9g\u00e9taline.jpg)\n\t\t<small>Advertisement for V\u00e9g\u00e9taline, 1910.</small>\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t![Portrait of Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, by Pierre Mignard, 1682](https://blog.nkb.fr/public/images/mignard.png)\n\t\t<small>Portrait of Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, by Pierre Mignard, 1682.</small>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\nThere is much more to this advertisement than a continuation of 17<sup>th</sup>-century themes, however. Firstly, V\u00e9g\u00e9taline is made of coconuts, as is clear from the drawing. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, coconuts were sourced from the Pacific. Given the very high interest for ethnography at the time, Og\u00e9 would have had no scarcity of source material if he had wanted to draw a Melanesian man or woman. Instead, he drew a Black child from the Jim Crow South in the style of US cartoonists. He also chose to represent the coconut tree in the shape of a banana tree with a bamboo stem. Cocnut trees look nothing like this and Og\u00e9 knew it very well, as this other version of the advert, which is likely older, attests.\n\n<div class=\"columns\">\n\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t![Advertisement for V\u00e9g\u00e9taline, around 1910](https://blog.nkb.fr/public/images/1910-V\u00e9g\u00e9taline.jpg)\n\t\t<small>Advertisement for V\u00e9g\u00e9taline, around 1910.</small>\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t![Advertisement for V\u00e9g\u00e9taline, around 1900](https://blog.nkb.fr/public/images/1900-V\u00e9g\u00e9taline.jpg)\n\t\t<small>Advertisement for V\u00e9g\u00e9taline, around 1900.</small>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\nThe people marketing V\u00e9g\u00e9taline, from the artist to the firm's management, deliberately created a syncretic Other, merging all possible embodiments of exoticism in the advert. Other brands of colonial vegetable fats made use of such exoticism and other, such as Palmin, which used pyramids as its logo.\n\nGiven that margarine was a product for the lowest classes, this racial othering might have served to overshadow class differences in favor of racial ones<sup><a name='note_11' id='#note_11' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_11'>11</a></sup>. Margarine advertising and consumption might have contributed to turning consumers from working-class poors into powerful _whites_, in what Kyla Wazana Tompkins called \"eating as a racially performative act\".<sup><a name='note_12' id='#note_12' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_12'>12</a></sup>\n\n### The absence of colonial vegetable fats in cookbooks\n\nThe third axis of my research program are cookbooks. Scholars have shown that, far from being a collection of unambiguous lists of instructions, cookbooks reveal a lot about the way their authors \u2013 and potentially their readers \u2013 saw the world<sup><a name='note_13' id='#note_13' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_13'>13</a></sup>.\n\nI started building a database of word frequencies French and German cookbooks, which currently holds 296 books. Because research is about sharing, I made it available to all online at [blog.nkb.fr/cookbooks](http://blog.nkb.fr/cookbooks/).\n\nIt shows that, despite the immense increase in fat available in Europe from the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century to the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, cookbook authors did not increase the number of frying recipes. More remarkably, bourgeois cookbooks entirely overlooked colonial vegetable fats and margarine. When they did mention them, it was usually not in praise. \"Margarine, cet affreux produit\" (this horrendous produce), wrote Paul Friand in 1896.<sup><a name='note_14' id='#note_14' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_14'>14</a></sup>\n\nManufacturers, notably H. Schlinck (producer of Palmin), published their own cookbooks and made them available to households by the thousands. Despite this aggressive push, other authors did not pick up any of their recipes that used coconut oil. There would have been a very good reason to mention it, as anyone who baked with coconut oil knows: the quantity needs to be reduced by 20% compared to butter (and water needs to be added in some cases). \n\nIn some cases, authors ignored these knew fats although they expected their readers to use them. _\u00c0 table chez tante Claire_, published in 1929, for instance, does not mention once margarine or coconut butter. But in the advertisements it carries, no less than three are for margarine!\n\n---\n\nI hope this research will shed some light on the links between whiteness and foodstuffs in France and Germany, if they exist. More generally, I hope it will inform questions around the perception of the origin and production situation of the food we eat today. Many products still depict a generic Other to illustrate their origin on their packaging, even after Mars Foods rebranded its famous parboiled rice.\n\nIt goes without saying that I would be very grateful for any piece of advice or literature recommendation!
